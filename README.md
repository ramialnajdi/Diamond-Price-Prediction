# Diamond-Price-Prediction.

In this project, we will make predictions of diamond prices based on their attributes. We already have a dataset that contains diamond prices and some of their features and we will analyse the dataset and we will build machine learning model to predict diamond prices.

## Diamond Price Dataset.

### This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. these attributes are:

        1.Content price price in US dollars ($326--$18,823) target column.

        2.carat weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01).

        3.cut quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).

        4.color diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best).

        5.clarity a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best)).

        6.x length in mm (0--10.74).

        7.y width in mm (0--58.9).

        8.z depth in mm (0--31.8).

        9.depth total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79).

         10.table width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95).
